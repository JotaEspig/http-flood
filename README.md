# HTTP Flood
HTTP Flood is a tool to do http flood attacks made in C. The idea of this project came from my other personal project, [SIGMA](https://github.com/JotaEspig/sigma), that's a website. The reason why I making this tool is to test my web application and to improve my knowledge about C programming and cyber security.
## Installation
**ONLY RUNS ON LINUX**


## Usage
**ONLY RUNS ON LINUX**
To run the program you can run the script [run.sh](https://github.com/JotaEspig/http-flood/blob/main/run.sh). This script will run the Makefile to compile the source code and run the executable file. The program receives 1 obligatory argument (host) and 3 optional arguments (port, number of attacks and filename containing the request to use as payload) and you can use [run.sh](https://github.com/JotaEspig/http-flood/blob/main/run.sh) or the executable file directly as well.

How to use the args:
```
./run.sh <host> [port] [number of attacks] [filename]
```
