# HTTP Flood
HTTP Flood is a tool to do http flood attacks made in C. The idea of this project came from my other personal project, [SIGMA](https://github.com/JotaEspig/sigma), that's a website. The reason why I making this tool is to test my web application and to improve my knowledge about C programming and cyber security.
